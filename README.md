# About the project
This was a school project where I had to create a Commando-Styled game, so I decided to just recreate Commando.

## ![Click here to play the game](https://kaaf.itch.io/commando)
  
## This game is not an exact copy of the original game, since it just has one level, but it includes some things that weren't on the original, like a pause menu and audio settings.
## Again, this game was just a school project so all images/sounds that were used are licensed by capcom and I don't intend on infringe any copyright claims.
